## Installation

To get started with **InsightForge-NLP**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ertonts666/InsightForge-NLP.git
   cd InsightForge-NLP
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   You can run the application using:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:main --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it via your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`. The API provides endpoints for both sentiment analysis and question answering.

### Sentiment Analysis

To analyze sentiment, send a POST request to the `/sentiment` endpoint with the text data. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/sentiment" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I love this product!"}'
```

### Question Answering

To use the question answering feature, send a POST request to the `/question` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/question" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question": "What is the capital of France?", "context": "France is a country in Europe."}'
```
