A state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing system that combines multilingual sentiment analysis and question-answering capabilities with retrieval augmentation. Built with industry-standard ML/AI engineering practices, this system demonstrates advanced NLP techniques and production-ready architecture.

## Features

### Multilingual Sentiment Analysis
- **Multi-language Support**: Analyzes sentiment in multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, German, and Chinese)
- **Fine-grained Analysis**: Provides detailed sentiment scores and confidence metrics
- **Aspect-based Sentiment**: Identifies sentiment for specific aspects mentioned in text
- **Context-aware Processing**: Handles context-specific sentiment detection
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large datasets with optimized batch operations

### Question-Answering with Retrieval Augmentation
- **Semantic Search**: Uses dense vector embeddings for semantic similarity search
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Dynamically add, update, and query documents
- **Source Attribution**: Provides confidence scores and source attribution for answers
- **Context Integration**: Answers questions based on provided context or retrieved documents
- **Efficient Indexing**: FAISS-powered vector database for fast similarity search at scale

## System Architecture

The InsightForge-NLP system is built with a modular, microservices-oriented architecture that ensures scalability, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Usage Examples

### Sentiment Analysis

#### Basic Sentiment Analysis
```python
from app.sentiment_analysis.analyzer import SentimentAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer (loads models on first use)
analyzer = SentimentAnalyzer()

# Analyze text in English
result = analyzer.analyze("I really enjoyed the conference, though the food was mediocre.", 
                         language="en")
print(result)
# Output: {'sentiment': 'positive', 'score': 0.78, 'confidence': 0.92, 'language': 'en'}

# Analyze text in Spanish
spanish_result = analyzer.analyze("La película fue excelente pero un poco larga.", 
                                 language="es")
print(spanish_result)
# Output: {'sentiment': 'positive', 'score': 0.65, 'confidence': 0.87, 'language': 'es'}
```

#### Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
```python
# Analyze sentiment for specific aspects
aspects_result = analyzer.analyze_with_aspects(
    "The hotel had beautiful views and the staff was friendly, but the rooms were small and the food was terrible.",
    aspects=["views", "staff", "rooms", "food"],
    language="en"
)

print(aspects_result['overall']['sentiment'])  # Overall sentiment
# Output: 'neutral'

for aspect, sentiment in aspects_result['aspects'].items():
    print(f"{aspect}: {sentiment['sentiment']} (score: {sentiment['score']:.2f})")
# Output:
# views: positive (score: 0.85)
# staff: positive (score: 0.78)
# rooms: negative (score: 0.32)
# food: negative (score: 0.15)
```

#### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple texts at once
texts = [
    "The product exceeded my expectations!",
    "Customer service was terrible and unresponsive.",
    "It's okay, nothing special but gets the job done."
]

batch_results = analyzer.batch_analyze(texts, language="en")
for text, result in zip(texts, batch_results):
    print(f"Text: {text}\nSentiment: {result['sentiment']} (score: {result['score']:.2f})\n")
```

### Question Answering

#### Basic Question Answering
```python
from app.question_answering.qa_system import QASystem

# Initialize the QA system
qa_system = QASystem()

# Add documents to the knowledge base
qa_system.add_document(
    "Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity.",
    metadata={"title": "Albert Einstein", "category": "physics"}
)

qa_system.add_document(
    "Marie Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.",
    metadata={"title": "Marie Curie", "category": "physics"}
)

# Ask questions
result1 = qa_system.answer_question("Who developed the theory of relativity?")
print(f"Answer: {result1['answer']}\nConfidence: {result1['confidence']:.2f}")
# Output: Answer: Albert Einstein
#         Confidence: 0.92

result2 = qa_system.answer_question("What did Marie Curie research?")
print(f"Answer: {result2['answer']}\nConfidence: {result2['confidence']:.2f}")
# Output: Answer: radioactivity
#         Confidence: 0.87
```

#### Providing Context
```python
# Answer with specific context
context = """The Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
It is named after the British comedy group Monty Python."""

result = qa_system.answer_question(
    question="Who created Python?",
    context=context
)
print(f"Answer: {result['answer']}\nConfidence: {result['confidence']:.2f}")
# Output: Answer: Guido van Rossum
#         Confidence: 0.95
```

#### Batch Question Answering
```python
# Answer multiple questions at once
questions = [
    "When was Einstein born?",
    "What did Marie Curie research?",
    "Who is the president of the United States?"  # Not in our knowledge base
]

batch_results = qa_system.batch_answer_questions(questions)
for question, result in zip(questions, batch_results):
    if result['has_answer']:
        print(f"Q: {question}\nA: {result['answer']}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Q: {question}\nA: No answer found\n")
```
